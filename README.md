# Treehousr Techdgree Project 5: An Interactive Photo Gallery 
 
In this project I have created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and CSS Grid Layout. Thumbnails and photos are provided with descriptions. At the top of the page, I have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be "back" and "previous" arrows to cycle through photos.
